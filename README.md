# Summary 

Many people perished in the Titanic disaster, but there were survivors. What factors affected whether someone survived or perished?
This visualization explores how changes of survival were affected by age, ticket fare and gender.

# Design

Two of the factors I wanted to visualize were continous so a scatter plot seemed the most apt visualization.
I also wanted to include gender as that's one of the first things people think about when it comes to Titanic survivers.
To do so, I used a custom symbol for the scatter plot markers to indicate the gender. 
Finally color is used to indicate survival.
